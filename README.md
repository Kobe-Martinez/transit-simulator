# transit-simulator
A Java-based Transit Simulation that models transportation systems using layered linked lists. It supports train, bus, and walking layers, with dynamic operations like adding stops, removing stations, and finding optimal paths. Designed for exploring data structures, pathfinding, and linked list concepts in a practical context.
